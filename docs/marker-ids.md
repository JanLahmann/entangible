## Dial tiles (42 / 43 / 44)

**RX-dial (42)**, **RY-dial (43)** and **RZ-dial (44)** are a single tile per
rotation axis whose **orientation on the board selects the angle** — "turn the
tile to turn the knob". The tile face is a dial: the four angle labels
(`π/4`, `π/2`, `π`, `−π/2`) sit on the four edges, the active one reading upright
at board-top, with a `▲` marking the canonical (unturned) top edge and the axis
name in the bottom band; the frame is the family colour (RX/RY `#9f1853`, RZ
`#33b1ff`).

Conventions (see `docs/design.md` "Dial tiles" and `markers.quadrant_rotation`):

- Orientation is measured in the **board frame** (rectified through the corner
  homography, not the camera frame): the marker's printed top-left corner is
  mapped to board mm and classified into a quadrant about the marker centroid.
- `r` = clockwise 90° steps from canonical (TL=0, TR=1, BR=2, BL=3).
- **angle = `ROTATION_ANGLES[r]`** → `π/4, π/2, π, −π/2` for `r = 0, 1, 2, 3`.

The dial is emitted **exactly like a classic rotation tile**: an RX-dial at
rotation `r` produces `{type: "RX", parameter: ROTATION_ANGLES[r]}` with id
`rx-<row>-<col>` — byte-identical to the fixed RX tile of that angle, so the
circuit JSON / QASM / simulation are indistinguishable downstream. The tile's
`GateSpec.dial_axis` names the axis; `GateSpec.parameter` stays `None` because
the angle is resolved from rotation at detection time. The stabilizer's key
includes the rotation (`(id, row, col, r)`), so turning a dial in place re-emits
the circuit under the usual asymmetric hysteresis.

## S / T tiles (40 / 41)

**S (ID 40)** and **T (ID 41)** are printed in the Z-family colour (`#33b1ff`)
with a big single-letter label, exactly like H/X/Y/Z. `@qamposer/react@0.2` has
no native `S`/`T` gate type, so the circuit builder emits each as its **RZ
equivalent**, carried on the `GateSpec.emit_as` field of the one `MARKER_TABLE`
entry:

- **S → `RZ(π/2)`** — emitted as `{type: "RZ", parameter: π/2}`; QASM shows
  `rz(pi/2)`.
- **T → `RZ(π/4)`** — emitted as `{type: "RZ", parameter: π/4}`; QASM shows
  `rz(pi/4)`.

The emitted gate id uses the RZ type (e.g. `rz-0-2`). It stays collision-free
against a real RZ(π/2) tile because the id embeds `(row, col)` and no two tiles
can share a cell — an S tile and an RZ(π/2) tile produce identical gates, which
is intended. When `@qamposer/react` gains native S/T types (gate table +
matrices + `s`/`t` QASM), drop the `emit_as` mapping.

## SWAP tile (45)

**SWAP (ID 45)** is a single `×` tile printed in the CNOT-family colour
(`#002d9c`) with a `SWAP ×` band caption; the `×` is drawn as a vector glyph
(two thick, round-capped diagonals), like the CNOT `●`/`⊕` glyphs, so it never
tofus in print. **Two `×` tiles in the same column pair into a SWAP between
their rows** — exactly like the CNOT `●`/`⊕` pairing: nearest-unpaired,
deterministic (ties broken by the lower row). More than two `×` in a column pair
the nearest and warn `lone_swap` on the leftover; a single `×` warns `lone_swap`
and is excluded.

`@qamposer/react@0.2` has no native `SWAP` gate type, so the circuit builder
emits a SWAP between rows `a` and `b` (with `a < b`) at column `c` as its
standard **3-CNOT decomposition**, all at the same position `c` and in this exact
array order:

```
cx(a, b), cx(b, a), cx(a, b)   # ids swap-{a}-{c}-1 / -2 / -3
```

The statevector/localAdapter applies gates in array order and `circuitToQasm`'s
stable sort by position preserves it, so the physics and the 3-`cx` QASM are
exactly correct. The builder anchors all three CNOTs at the lower row `a` when
ordering gates so the triple is never reshuffled by control row. The single
place that knows this decomposition is `circuit_builder.emit_swap` (mirrored in
the pocket TS `emitSwap`); switching to a native `{type: "SWAP", control,
target, position}` gate later is a one-function edit.

**Known cosmetic:** because the emission is three CNOTs in one column, the
`@qamposer/react` editor overlap-renders them in a single column. This is
accepted for now; a native SWAP display arrives with the qamposer-react fork
(then `emit_swap` returns one `{type: "SWAP", …}` gate and the overlap goes away).

## Control tile ● (14) as a generic modifier

The control tile **● (ID 14)** is a *generic controlled-gate modifier*. In one
column, a single-qubit gate tile + one ● is that gate's **controlled version**;
the **control** qubit is the ●'s row, the **target** is the gate's row:

| Column contents | Emitted gate | QASM (qelib1) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ● + `X` (or ● + ⊕) | `CNOT` (`CX`) | `cx q[c], q[t];` |
| ● + `Y` | `CY` | `cy q[c], q[t];` |
| ● + `Z` | `CZ` | `cz q[c], q[t];` |
| ● + `H` | `CH` | `ch q[c], q[t];` |
| ● + `S` | `CS` | `cu1(pi/2) q[c], q[t];` |
| ● + `T` | `CT` | `cu1(pi/4) q[c], q[t];` |
| ● ● + `X` | `CCX` (Toffoli) | `ccx q[c1], q[c2], q[t];` |

**Backward compatibility.** The target half **⊕ (ID 15)** is still a valid
X-target: `● + ⊕ ≡ ● + X`, and the legacy `●`/`⊕` **CNOT pairing** (nearest-
unpaired, deterministic, multiple pairs per column) is unchanged. Note ⊕ only
ever means an X-target — `● ● + ⊕` stays the legacy *one CX + one lone control*
pairing, **not** a CCX (a CCX requires an `X` gate tile).

**CS/CT are controlled-*phase* gates.** Unlike the bare `S`/`T` tiles (emitted as
`RZ(π/2)`/`RZ(π/4)`), the controlled forms emit `cu1(π/2)`/`cu1(π/4)` — the true
controlled-`diag(1, i)` / `diag(1, e^{iπ/4})`. A controlled-`RZ` would carry a
different control-conditional global phase, so the engine applies `S`/`T` (not
`RZ`) as the target unitary, matching `cu1`.

**Ambiguities → excluded with a `control_ambiguous` warning** (the tiles are
never guessed at): ● with two or more gate tiles in its column; two ● with a
gate other than `X`; three or more ●; `● + ⊕ + another gate`; and **`RX`/`RY`/
`RZ` + ●** (no controlled rotations in v1 — dial tiles count as rotations). A ●
with no gate and no ⊕ in its column stays the existing `lone_control` warning.

**Representation & known limitation.** `@qamposer/react@0.2`'s `GateType` has no
controlled gate beyond `CNOT`, so `CY`/`CZ`/`CH`/`CS`/`CT`/`CCX` are carried as
their own gate types in the Circuit JSON (a `CCX` adds a `control2` field) and
applied directly by `shared/quantum` (generic controlled-U via a control mask on
the basis indices) and by `qasm.py` / the pocket `qasm.ts` port (native QASM
above). The library's `CircuitEditor` does not render these types natively, so
in camera mode a controlled gate shows as a plain labelled box without the
control line — a display-only gap, fixed upstream when the fork gains native
controlled-gate types (upstream wishlist). The build-on-screen manual editor can
only place what the library's palette offers (`CNOT` among them), so it cannot
yet express e.g. `CH`.

## Reserved

IDs **46–49** (`RESERVED_IDS = range(46, 50)`) are reserved for future tiles.
They are never emitted by the current detector or assets generator, and no
current gate is assigned into this range. (IDs 40/41 are live S/T tiles,
42/43/44 are live RX/RY/RZ dial tiles and 45 is the live SWAP × tile — see
above.)

## Notes

- **Corners (0–3)** are board fiducials placed TL/TR/BR/BL. Orientation is
  implicit from which corner is which; the board homography works with 3 of 4
  corners visible.
- **Rotation gates (20–31)** encode each angle variant as a *distinct* marker ID
  (π/4, π/2, π, −π/2) rather than a parameterised marker, so a single tile fully
  specifies its gate. Angle labels are rendered by `pretty_angle()` /
  `GateSpec.param_label` so tiles and QASM format angles identically. The **dial
  tiles (42–44)** cover the same four angles per axis with one physical tile,
  choosing the angle from the tile's board-frame rotation instead of the ID.
- **CNOT (14/15)** is split into a control (●) and target (⊕) tile; the two are
  paired within a column by the circuit builder. The ● is also a **generic
  controlled-gate modifier** — see "Control tile ● (14) as a generic modifier".
- Base tile gate types match `@qamposer/react`'s `GateType`
  (`H`, `X`, `Y`, `Z`, `RX`, `RY`, `RZ`, `CNOT`). The controlled forms emitted by
  the ● modifier (`CY`, `CZ`, `CH`, `CS`, `CT`, `CCX`) are additional Circuit-JSON
  gate types with no native `@qamposer/react` equivalent (see that section).
